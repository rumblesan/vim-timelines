# vim-timelines #

A Vim plugin for [TimeLines](https://github.com/lnfiniteMonkeys/TimeLines)

This plugin uses [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), a known and loved terminal
multiplexer, for communicating with between Vim and the TimeLines interpreter.

This plugin is entirely based on [vim-tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vim-tidal)
as both live-coding environments work with a Haskell REPL. Many thanks to the
maintainers and contributors of that plugin for their work.

The two plugins will likely diverge significantly over time.
